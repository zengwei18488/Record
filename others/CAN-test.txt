     Set bit-timing

Set the bit-rate to 50Kbits/sec with triple sampling using the following command

$ ip link set can0 type can bitrate 50000 triple-sampling on

or

$ canconfig can0 bitrate 50000 ctrlmode triple-sampling on

    Device bring up

Bring up the device using the command:

$ ip link set can0 up

or

$ canconfig can0 start 

    Transfer packets

Packet transmission can be achieve by using cansend and cansequence utilities.

a. Transmit 8 bytes with standard packet id number as 0x10

$ cansend can0 -i 0x10 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66 0x77 0x88

b. Transmit 8 bytes with extended packet id number as 0x800

$ cansend can0 -i 0x800 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66 0x77 0x88 -e

c. Transmit 20 packets of 8 bytes each with same extended packet id number as 0xFFFFF

$ cansend can0 -i 0xFFFFF 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66 0x77 0x88 -e --loop=20

d. Transmit a sequence of numbers from 0x00-0xFF, till the buffer availability

$ cansequence can0

e. Transmit a sequence of numbers from 0x00-0xFF and roll-back in a continuous loop

$ cansequence can0 -p

    Receive packets

Packet reception can be achieve by using candump utility

$ candump can0
