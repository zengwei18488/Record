################################################################################
The bblayers.conf configuration file has been created for you with some
default values.  Please verify the contents of your conf/bblayers.conf
file for correctness.

NOTE: Any additional entries to this file will be lost if the ./oe-layertool-setup.sh
      script is run again.  To add entries permanently to this file
      please add them to the config file used and rerun the
      ./oe-layertool-setup.sh script.



################################################################################
The local.conf configuration file has been created for you with some
default values.  Please verify the contents of your conf/local.conf
file for correctness.

By default the number of threads used by the build is set to the number
of CPUs found on your system.

NOTE: You will probably want to change the default MACHINE setting in the
      local.conf file to the machine you are trying to build.



################################################################################
A setenv file has been created for you in the conf directory.  Please verify
The contents of this file.  Once you have verified the contents please source
this file to configure your environment for building:

    . conf/setenv

You can then start building using the bitbake command.  You will likely want
to set the MACHINE option if you have not done so in your local.conf file.

For example:
    MACHINE=xxxxx bitbake <target>
